### Mr E.Vil calls you at the phone

Great work for now...
we now need to have multiple custom words that are replaced by unwanted words in sequential order

For example - assume the following replacements are defined

- objection -> acquiescence, acceptance
- bad -> good, nice, great

Thus, the following sentence

```
Repeat with me! Objection is bad, objection is bad, objection is bad, objection is bad!
```

becomes

```
Repeat with me! Acquiescence is good, acceptance is nice, acquiescence is great, acceptance is good!
```

can you add this functionality NOW!?
