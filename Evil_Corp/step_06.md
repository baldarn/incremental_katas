Great work for now...

Lots of companies are starting to use our tool. Perfect!

The censorship department of Faisbuk ask us to add a functionality.
They are receaving complains from journalists that all the text analized is redacted and they want to have only a certain lines of text to be analyzed from the program.

For example, if the text is:

```
We want to fight the power! 
we won't be standing still leaving the evil corporation doing their interest!
please join us in this rebellion!
we have cookies!
```

They would like to limit the scope of the censorship to only certain lines:
<pre><code><ins>We want to fight the power!</ins>
<ins>we won't be standing still leaving the evil corporation doing their interest! we are rebelling!</ins>
please join us in this rebellion!
<ins>we have cookies!</ins>
</pre></code>

Please, go and do this..... NOW!
